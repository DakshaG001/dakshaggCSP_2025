# Study Plan

1. Review Team Teach pages, create notes for them and a plan for review to put into flashcards (notes are below will organize better)

2. Review Collegeboard Videos and practice key topics with flashcards

3. [AP Computer Science Principles Student Handout](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) <- Review the student Handbook

# ðŸ“˜ AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) Overview

## ðŸ§  Big Ideas

### 1. Creative Development (CRD)
- Emphasizes collaboration in program development.
- Utilizes iterative processes: investigating, designing, prototyping, and testing.
- Focuses on program design and development.
- **Exam Weight**: 10%â€“13%

### 2. Data (DAT)
- Explores how computers handle and process data.
- Covers data compression and extracting information from data.
- **Exam Weight**: 17%â€“22%

### 3. Algorithms and Programming (AAP)
- Involves developing algorithms and using abstractions.
- Includes simulations and algorithmic efficiency.
- **Exam Weight**: 30%â€“35%

### 4. Computer Systems and Networks (CSN)
- Studies how computer systems and networks operate.
- Topics include the Internet and parallel/distributed computing.
- **Exam Weight**: 11%â€“15%

### 5. Impact of Computing (IOC)
- Examines the effects of computing on society, economy, and culture.
- Discusses the digital divide, computing bias, and safe computing practices.
- **Exam Weight**: 21%â€“26%

## ðŸ§ª Create Performance Task (CPT)

### General Requirements
- Minimum of 9 hours of class time allocated.
- Students may collaborate on program development but must complete the video and Personalized Project Reference individually.

### Submission Components
1. **Program Code**:
   - PDF file containing all program code with comments.
   - Must include:
     - Instructions for input (user, device, online data stream, or file).
     - Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to manage program complexity.
     - At least one student-developed procedure with:
       - Procedure name.
       - Return type (if necessary).
       - One or more parameters.
     - An algorithm within the procedure that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration.
     - Calls to the student-developed procedure.
     - Instructions for output based on input and program functionality.

2. **Video**:
   - Demonstrates the running of the program and its functionality.
   - Created independently by the student.

3. **Personalized Project Reference**:
   - Includes code segments and written responses.
   - Completed individually without collaboration.
