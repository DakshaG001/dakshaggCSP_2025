    "Q21- Which of the following code segments will move the robot to the gray square?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #B; This is because the code moves the object two blocks forwards, rotates it three times to the right then moves it forward three blocks forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Q26- Which of the following replacements for missing code can be used to move the robot to the gray square?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A; Similar process to Q21, the code is saying to move the object right if there is blocks to allow it, and if that is true then more turn right and move forwards making it the best choice for this question\n",
    "\n",
    "Q31- Which of the following statements is true?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: C; because it moves the robot towareds the gray square by repeatdly moving it forward, left and right rotation. Program 2 does the simmilar thing my rotating and moving it to the top of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q41- Which of the following could be used in the procedure to calculate a studentâ€™s total points earned in the course and store the result in the variable One word, adjusted Total ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: B; the max var is used to replace for the higher of the given scores. Which is then put to final exam score and then assigned to the adjusted total\n",
    "\n",
    "Q44- A computer program uses 4 bits to represent nonnegative integers. Which of the following statements describe a possible result when the program uses this number representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: B; 12+3 causes an overflow error eliminating it from the options\n",
    "\n",
    "Q52- Executing which of the following sequences of steps will enable the algorithm to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: D; algorithm must execute the shorten step after keep palindromes part, if not the palidromes step would not be able to compute wether the original word was a palidrome or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Q55- Which of the following best describes the result of running the procedure?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: D; following the steps in the procedure, the response would have to be equal to y and yes which is not possible in this scenario, therefor resulting in it being false\n",
    "\n",
    "Q60- Which of the following are ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Also D; first part got right, did not select D. D is correct since list creation is an example of data abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Q62- A free online encyclopedia contains articles that can be written and edited by any user. Which of the following are advantages the online encyclopedia has over a traditional paper-based encyclopedia?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: C+D; Got D corret but not C. C is correct as an online encyclopedia allows others to edit and contribute towards it \n",
    "\n",
    "Q63- Which two lines of code should be removed so that the program will work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: B+D; Got B right not D. D is right since if count is outside if statement, all entries will increase in the list instead of the prime ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Q65- A programmer suspects that an error in the program is caused by this procedure. Under which of the following conditions will the procedure NOT return the correct product?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: B+D; Got B right not D. d is right because based on the output the correct product should not have both x and y be positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Q66- For which of the following values of One word, the List will Smallest, open parenthesis, one word, the List, close parenthesis NOT return the intended value?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: C+D; For C it returns 20 which is not the least value, and for D it returns 30 which is also not the least value\n",
