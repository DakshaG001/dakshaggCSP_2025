    "## ‚úÖ What is Crowdsourcing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is the practice of gathering input, ideas, or services from a large group of people, typically via the internet. It enables the completion of tasks that are often too complex, expensive, or large in scale for a small team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Relies on mass participation\n",
    "- Increases diversity of input\n",
    "- Breaks tasks into smaller components\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Big Idea 5 ‚Äì Impact of Computing:** Crowdsourcing increases access and collaboration.\n",
    "- **Data Aggregation:** User input improves predictive models and AI.\n",
    "- **Innovations:** Used in platforms like Wikipedia, Foldit, citizen science apps, and open-source development.\n",

    "## üì∫ Case Study: Foldit Gamers Solve HIV Enzyme Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foldit is an online puzzle game that simulates protein folding.\n",
    "- Gamers, not scientists, solved the structure of an HIV-related enzyme in 10 days.\n",
    "- Demonstrates how crowdsourcing can outperform experts and AI in certain tasks.\n",

    "## üåê Real-World Examples of Crowdsourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Wikipedia\n",
    "- Free encyclopedia created by global volunteers.\n",
    "- Pros: Constantly updated, collaborative.\n",
    "- Cons: Risk of bias, needs fact-checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Spotify Collaborative Playlists\n",
    "- Users contribute songs to shared playlists.\n",
    "- Pros: Community-curated, diverse.\n",
    "- Cons: Quality control issues, inconsistent themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Foldit (Scientific Gaming)\n",
    "- Players solve real biological problems through gameplay.\n",
    "- Pros: Harnesses human intuition and logic.\n",
    "- Cons: Requires verification by experts.\n",

    "### Wisdom of the Crowd\n",
    "- Uses collective judgment from a group to make decisions.\n",
    "- Example: Customer reviews guiding product improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crowd Creation\n",
    "- Public submits ideas or content.\n",
    "- Example: Logo contests, custom product designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crowd Voting\n",
    "- Community votes on submitted options.\n",
    "- Example: Choosing new product flavors or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crowdfunding\n",
    "- Public contributes money toward a shared goal.\n",
    "- Example: Kickstarter projects, GoFundMe campaigns.\n",
