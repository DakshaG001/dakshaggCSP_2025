    "\n",
    "**Types of Graphs**\n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs**: Edges go both ways (e.g., Facebook friendships)\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs**: Edges have direction (e.g., Twitter followers)\n",
    "- **Unweighted Graphs**: All edges equal\n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have a cost (e.g., distance in a map)\n",
