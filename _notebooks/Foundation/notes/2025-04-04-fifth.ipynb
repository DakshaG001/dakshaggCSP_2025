    "# Study Plan: Python Lists and Filtering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This study plan covers the concepts of **Lists** and **Filtering Algorithms** in Python. The goal is to understand how lists are used in Python, how to manipulate them, and how to apply filtering algorithms effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- **Understand Python lists**, their properties, and manipulation methods.\n",
    "- **Master list operations** (access, modify, remove, append).\n",
    "- **Understand and apply filtering algorithms** to extract data based on conditions.\n",
    "- **Evaluate the performance** of filtering algorithms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 1: Introduction to Lists\n",
    "- **Definition**: A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements in Python. It can store multiple data types.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Creating a list**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    example_list = [42, 3.1415, \"Python\", True]\n",
    "    print(example_list)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Accessing List Elements**:\n",
    "    - Positive indexing (starts from 0).\n",
    "    - Negative indexing (starts from -1 for the last element).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\"]\n",
    "    print(colors[2])  # Output: blue\n",
    "    print(colors[-1]) # Output: yellow\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Modifying Lists**:\n",
    "    - Change an element: `colors[1] = \"purple\"`\n",
    "    - Add an element: `colors.append(\"orange\")`\n",
    "    - Remove an element: `colors.remove(\"red\")`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(colors)  # Output: ['purple', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange']\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popcorn Hack #1 (5 minutes)\n",
    "- Create a list `movies` with your four favorite movies.\n",
    "- Replace the second movie with a new one, add another movie, and display the updated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 2: Filtering Algorithms\n",
    "- **Definition**: Filtering algorithms extract elements based on specific conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Basic Example**: Filter even numbers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    numbers = [11, 14, 18, 23, 29, 32, 40]\n",
    "    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n",
    "    print(even_numbers)  # Output: [14, 18, 32, 40]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popcorn Hack #2 (8 minutes)\n",
    "- Given the list `ages = [15, 20, 34, 16, 18, 21, 14, 19]`, write Python code to create a new list with ages 18 or older.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 3: Efficiency and Performance of Filtering Algorithms\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: Filtering algorithms usually iterate through the entire list, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - Filtering large datasets takes longer.\n",
    "  - Understanding efficiency helps optimize performance in large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Hacks\n",
    "1. **Watch the Videos**: Write **3 bullet points per video**. If you have **more than 6 bullet points**, you'll be rewarded.\n",
    "2. **Create Python Code**: \n",
    "    - Initialize a list of numbers from 1 to 30.\n",
    "    - Filter out and display numbers divisible by 3 but not by 5.\n",
    "    - Print both the original and filtered lists.\n",
    "3. **Develop a Function**:\n",
    "    - Write `filter_spotify_data` that reads data from a Spotify CSV and filters songs with over 10 million streams. Display the filtered data clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review Questions\n",
    "1. **Explain what lists are in Python**, including how to modify and manipulate them.\n",
    "2. **Provide a real-world scenario** where a filtering algorithm might be applied.\n",
    "3. **Discuss why analyzing the efficiency** of filtering algorithms is important for software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "- Submit detailed code implementations and answers to the review questions by **4/10 at 11:59 PM**.\n"
