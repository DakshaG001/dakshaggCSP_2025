    "## Review Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Explain what lists are in Python, including how to modify and manipulate them.\n",
    "- **Definition**: Lists in Python are ordered, mutable collections of items that can hold elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, or even other lists).\n",
    "- **Creation**: Lists are created using square brackets (`[]`) or the `list()` constructor.\n",
    "- **Modification**:\n",
    "  - Add elements using `.append()` (to the end) or `.insert()` (at a specific index).\n",
    "  - Remove elements using `.remove()` (by value) or `.pop()` (by index).\n",
    "  - Replace elements by directly assigning a new value to a specific index (e.g., `list[1] = \"new_value\"`).\n",
    "- **Manipulation**:\n",
    "  - Use slicing (`list[start:stop]`) to extract sublists.\n",
    "  - Use list comprehensions for concise filtering or transformations.\n",
    "  - Sort lists with `.sort()` (in-place) or `sorted()` (returns a new sorted list).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Provide a real-world scenario where a filtering algorithm might be applied.\n",
    "- **Scenario**: A filtering algorithm could be used in an e-commerce platform to display products based on user preferences. For example, filtering a list of products to show only those within a specific price range or with a minimum customer rating.\n",
    "- **Example**: A user searches for laptops priced under $1000 with at least a 4-star rating. The platform applies a filtering algorithm to extract and display only the relevant products from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Discuss why analyzing the efficiency of filtering algorithms is important for software development.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Efficient filtering algorithms ensure that applications can handle large datasets without significant delays, improving user experience.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: As data grows, inefficient algorithms may lead to performance bottlenecks. Analyzing efficiency helps ensure the system can scale effectively.\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient algorithms reduce computational resource usage (e.g., CPU and memory), which is critical for cost-effective and sustainable software.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Applications**: In scenarios like financial trading or recommendation systems, filtering must be done in real-time. Analyzing efficiency ensures the system meets time constraints."
