    "## Popcorn Hack: Identify PII\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Which of the following is considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Fingerprint\n",
    "B. Favorite Color  \n",
    "C. Zip Code\n",
    "D. Job Title\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: A. Fingerprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: A fingerprint is biometric data that uniquely identifies an individual and is therefore considered PII. While zip codes can sometimes be used as part of a larger data set to identify individuals, they are not inherently PII on their own. Favorite colors and job titles are generally not unique enough to identify specific individuals.\n",

    "## Pop Quiz: Multifactor Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Which of the following is NOT an example of a multifactor authentication (MFA) factor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. A password used to log into an email account.\n",
    "B. A verification code sent to a user's phone.\n",
    "C. A fingerprint scan on a smartphone.\n",
    "D. A username required to log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: C. A fingerprint scan on a smartphone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A username is an identifier that tells the system which account you're trying to access, but it doesn't authenticate that you are the rightful owner of that account. The three main factors of authentication are:\n",
    "1. Something you know (like passwords) - Option A\n",
    "2. Something you have (like a phone receiving verification codes) - Option B\n",
    "3. Something you are (like biometric data) - Option C\n",
    "\n",
    "Usernames are identifiers, not authentication factors, as they're often publicly known and don't verify identity.\n",

    "## Popcorn Hack: Encryption Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Which of the following is an example of symmetric encryption?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Evy buys a locked box that operates using two different codes. When the first code is entered, a slot opens that allows a message to be put in the box. When the second code is entered, the door to the box opens. Evy gives the first code to her friends so they can leave messages for her and keeps the second code to herself so that she is the only one who can retrieve the messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Juan writes a message to send to Kelly and slides the message through a slot in the front of Kelly's locker. Juan knows that Kelly has not shared her locker combination with anyone, so no one other than Kelly will be able to read the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: B. Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is symmetric encryption because both parties use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used to encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. Option A describes asymmetric encryption (using different keys), while options C and D don't involve encryption at all, just secure delivery methods.\n",

    "## üîê What Makes a Good Password?\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong password is crucial for protecting your personal information online. Here are key characteristics of a secure password:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length**: Aim for at least 12 characters; longer passwords are generally more secure.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Each account should have its own distinct password.\n",
    "- **Avoid Personal Information**: Do not include easily guessable details like birthdays, names, or common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Passphrases**:  \n",
    "  Consider creating a passphrase‚Äîa sequence of random words or a sentence that's easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  \n",
    "  Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utilize a Password Manager**:  \n",
    "  These tools can generate, retrieve, and store complex passwords securely, reducing the burden of remembering multiple passwords.\n",
