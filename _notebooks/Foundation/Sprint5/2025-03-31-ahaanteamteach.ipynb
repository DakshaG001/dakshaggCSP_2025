    "   - Automatically applies when work is created\n",
    "   - Lasts for author's life plus 70 years (in most countries)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trademarks**\n",
    "   - Protects brands, logos, and distinctive signs\n",

    "## Popcorn Hack 3: Creative Commons and Copyright Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creative Commons License Definition\n",
    "A Creative Commons (CC) license is a public copyright license that enables free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. CC licenses are used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon their work while maintaining certain rights. Unlike traditional \"all rights reserved\" copyright, Creative Commons licenses offer \"some rights reserved\" flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Creative Commons Licenses:\n",
    "- **CC BY**: Attribution (credit the original creator)\n",
    "- **CC BY-SA**: Attribution-ShareAlike (credit and license new creations under identical terms)\n",
    "- **CC BY-ND**: Attribution-NoDerivs (credit and no modifications)\n",
    "- **CC BY-NC**: Attribution-NonCommercial (credit and non-commercial use only)\n",
    "- **CC BY-NC-SA**: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n",
    "- **CC BY-NC-ND**: Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs\n",
    "- **CC0**: Public Domain dedication (no rights reserved)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptions to Copyright Law\n",
    "1. **Fair Use**: Limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Exceptions**: Special provisions for educational institutions to use copyrighted works for teaching purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Public Domain**: Works whose intellectual property rights have expired, been forfeited, or are inapplicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transformative Use**: Creating something new that alters the original work with new expression, meaning, or message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **First Sale Doctrine**: Allows the purchaser of a copyrighted work to sell, display, or dispose of that particular copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Library and Archive Exceptions**: Special provisions for libraries and archives to make copies for preservation and replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Open Systems Lower Intellectual Barriers\n",
    "Systems like Creative Commons, open sourcing, and open access contribute to knowledge sharing by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Democratizing Knowledge**: Making information accessible to those who cannot afford traditional publishing fees or subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accelerating Innovation**: Allowing researchers and developers to build upon existing work rather than starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encouraging Collaboration**: Creating communities where improvements and modifications benefit everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Promoting Transparency**: Open code and open research methods can be reviewed, validated, and improved by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Impact**: Removing geographical barriers to accessing information, particularly important for developing regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems create ecosystems where knowledge can flow more freely while still providing frameworks for attribution and proper use of intellectual work.\n",

    "## Homework Hack : Choosing a License for Personal Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Select a License\n",
    "For my personal repository containing the San Diego Hospital Recommendation Service, I've selected the **Apache License 2.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Explain Your Choice\n",
    "I chose the Apache License 2.0 for my hospital recommendation project because it provides strong patent protection clauses that are crucial when dealing with healthcare-related technology implementations. This license grants users freedom to use the code commercially while requiring them to preserve copyright notices, which helps maintain attribution as the project potentially grows in the healthcare community. The explicit patent grant in Apache 2.0 offers additional legal protection against patent litigation, which is especially important in the healthcare sector where intellectual property concerns are significant. Additionally, the license's clear terms on trademark usage ensure that my project's identity remains protected even as others build upon or modify the recommendation algorithms and data processing components.\n",

    "## Popcorn Hack 4: Ways to Prevent Copyright Infringement\n",
    "\n",
    "I discussed with [Partner's Name] and we came up with the following ways to prevent copyright infringement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain Proper Licenses** - Purchase or acquire appropriate licenses for content you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ask for Permission** - Contact the copyright holder directly to request permission before using their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Creative Commons Materials** - Search for and use content that has Creative Commons licenses which explicitly allow certain uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Utilize Public Domain Works** - Use works that are in the public domain and free from copyright restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create Original Content** - Develop your own original work rather than copying others'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Provide Proper Attribution** - When allowed to use copyrighted material, always properly cite and attribute the original creator.\n",
