    "\n",
    "The purpose of our group’s program is to create a multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by Scribble.io. This program allows players to take turns drawing while others guess the word or phrase being illustrated. The goal is to provide an entertaining and interactive way for people to engage in creative gameplay, fostering collaboration, quick thinking, and creativity.\n",

    "### My Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "My purpose is to design a leaderboard so that people can compete with their friends in order to achieve a higher score than them in certain drawings. This allows people to interact with one another more and have a little brainbreak to relieve them of their stress a little\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My contribution\n",
    "Designed a leaderboard with CRUD operation support that can also be tested in postman and has a database to be saved and backed up\n",

    "### Design\n",
    "User submit their username, their drawing they did, and the score they got for the drawing (this depends on the amount of times they guessed it correct). They have the free will to change it however they want. even cheat a little :) "
