    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In this code segment, the count variable is reset to 0 each time the loop iterates over a new element in the list. This causes the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended count of occurrences. For example, if the list contains the word \"maple\" once, the count is increased to 1 when \"maple\" is encountered, but it is reset to 0 when the loop moves to the next element, resulting in an incorrect return value of 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Corrected Answer:** B & D\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Because `y` is initially negative, the loop condition `count ≥ y` is initially `true`, so the body of the loop is never executed and `0` is returned.\n",

    "**Explanation:** The code iterates through originalList from left to right, inserting even elements at the beginning of newList. This results in a reversed order of even elements in newList.

    "**Explanation:** For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, its steps must be bounded by a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements \\(2n\\) times (twice for each of \\(n\\) elements), which is considered reasonable. Algorithm II accesses elements \\(n^2\\) times (once for each pair of \\(n\\) elements), which is also reasonable. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, a constant number, which is always reasonable.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Using 7 bits allows for representing up to 128 unique values, which can accommodate up to 128 employees. Since each bit can represent two possible states (0 or 1), the total number of unique combinations or distinct values that can be represented with 7 bits is \\( 2^7 = 128 \\). This makes 7-bit representation suitable for systems where there is a need to assign a unique identifier to each employee in a group of up to 128, ensuring that every individual can be represented without overlap.\n",

    "**Explanation:** This code segment moves the robot forward as long as there is an open square in front of it. Once it encounters a blocked square, the robot rotates right. Starting from its initial location, the robot moves to the upper right corner of the grid, then rotates right. It then moves to the bottom right corner, rotates right again, moves to the bottom left corner, rotates right once more, and finally moves forward two squares to reach the gray square.\n",
